<H3 style="color:#339966;">Why Marketing?</h3>
<p>At the risk of sounding cliche, my parents, who are unquestionably my role models, are the embodiment of the American dream.  My mother was born in Peru, but when she stepped foot onto U.S. soil, she had the entrepreneurial spirit running through her veins.  Mom lived up to the expectations of the First Generation.  She had the talent and ingenuity to establish her own marketing business, Gem Graphics.  Ever since the fourth grade, I would jump at any chance to spend time with her at her office. Before I knew it, I was put to work choosing designs that were originally tailored for private businesses.  I had a knack for logos that fit with the mission of a company, and I slowly worked my way up the ladder as an actual paid employee.  Indeed, I have had my share of busy work, but I branched out to incorporate design work into apparel wear.  Advertising and marketing were second nature to me, and I made optimal use of my bilingual language skills.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this formative experience was the opportunity to split my time with my father’s business.  Paralleling my mother’s initiatives, I broadened the scope of my experiences through my work at his independent company, Washington Gem and Mineral Co.  Since he was a youngster, my dad was drawn to the work of cutting stone and polishing gems.  He built upon the foundations of his childhood dreams by establishing a business that refined beautiful gems into finished products. As a young girl, I went with him to countless trade shows. I was the proverbial sponge, absorbing all of the nuances of public relations and sales.  My dad was the master of the art of communicating, and I learned well about how to connect with customers. I was recently accepted to the Terry School of Business at the University of Georgia as a marketing major, and I can’t help but thank my parents for introducing me to business, marketing in particular, at such a young age. </p>
